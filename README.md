## Project Features

### Search Bar
The user can enter a movie into the search bar to get information on a particular movie. After the button is clicked, it will fetch the required data from the two APIs.

### Movie Information Display 
After the user uses the search bar, the user will see the information about the movie appear. This information will give them a name, release date, poster image, rating, and plot that is fetched from the TMDB API. Below that the user will be presented with a list of streaming services that the user can watch the movie on that is fetched from the Streaming Availability API.

### Watchlist
There is a button in the upper right corner that the user can click on to add the movie to a watchlist. The watchlist will be saved to local storage and allow the user to access the movie information just by clicking on the item. Items can also be removed by clicking an **X** next to the button.

## Styling
The website uses Bulma for styling. Bulma is a CSS framework that has predefined CSS classes. These classes are used to make a better, nicer, and more responsive user interface.
